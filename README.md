**---Text-to-Speech-Conversion-with-Amazon-Polly---**
Transforming written text into spoken words using computer-generated voices is the aim of text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. Several important goals are involved in this process: <br />

**Accessibility**: Providing written material that people with vision impairments or reading challenges can understand.<br />
**Convenience**: Enabling consumers to multitask by consuming material hands-free, such reading articles while driving.<br />
**Efficiency**: Giving users a rapid method to transform text-based content into audio so they can consume it more quickly.<br />
**Engagement**: Improving user interaction with material by providing a different method of interaction.<br />
**Language Acquisition**: Facilitating language acquisition by ensuring that words and phrases are spoken and toned correctly.<br />
**Customer service**: Adding realistic voice functionality to automated customer service answers.<br />
